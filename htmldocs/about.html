              Creating is what I love the most. Thats why composing music and
              writing software is such a great fit for me. I really get a kick
              out of creating something and letting it take on a life of its own
              in the hands of the user or the listener.

            <h3>Where I began</h3>
            <p>
              At the age of six I stumbled upon the most wonderful adventure a
              young boy could dream of. An adventure of the mind and of the
              heart! My grandmother taught me the first melodies I ever played
              on the piano. They where children songs that I could sing by
              heart, but to play them and to hear the melodies come from a
              different instrument instantly caught my interest. Ever since that
              day I have played the piano, and ever since that day I have
              composed my own melodies. My interest in music and sound grew and
              I soon started studying music. At first I took piano lessons, and
              as I grew older I continued to study music through high school.
              Immediately after finishing high school i applied for and got
              accepted into the Academy of Music in Malmö in Sweden. Well there
              I studied both composition and arrangement as well as singing and
              piano and also pedagogics in art. My heart truly lies with
              composing music and I absolutely love the synergy that comes from
              combining different art forms. This, and my interest for creating
              new sounds, has lead me to compose both acoustic and electronic
              music for rock and pop bands, dance choreographers, photographers,
              directors of film and other musicians. In 2008 I created the music
              company Valley Creek Music Productions. This is a firm concerning
              music production and artistic ventures such as composing and
              recording scores for movies, live events, session recordings for
              other artists and music consultation.
